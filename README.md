cd CampusParty
```

2. Install dependencies:

```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase configuration:
```
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket

FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

4. Start the development server:

```

## Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Authentication with Email/Password
3. Create a Firestore database
4. Set up the following Firestore collections:
   - `users`: Store user information
   - `parties`: Store party details
5. Deploy Firestore security rules and indexes:

   ```bash
   # Install Firebase CLI
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   
   # Login to Firebase
   firebase login
   
   # Initialize Firebase in your project
   firebase init
   
   # Deploy Firestore rules
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   
   # Deploy Firestore indexes
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
   ```

   Alternatively, you can run the helper script:
   ```bash
   node deploy-firebase-config.js
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Firestore Index Errors

If you see errors like "The query requires an index", you need to create the necessary Firestore indexes:

1. Use the provided `firestore.indexes.json` file to deploy all required indexes:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
   ```

2. Alternatively, click on the URL in the error message to create the specific index needed.

### Permission Errors

If you see "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors:

1. Make sure you're logged in to the app
2. Verify that your Firestore security rules are properly deployed
3. Check that you're using the correct Firebase project
