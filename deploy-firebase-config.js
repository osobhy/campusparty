FIREBASE CONFIGURATION DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================================

To deploy your Firestore security rules and indexes, follow these steps:

1. Install the Firebase CLI if you haven't already:
   npm install -g firebase-tools

2. Login to your Firebase account:
   firebase login

3. Initialize Firebase in your project (if not already done):
   firebase init

   - Select Firestore
   - Choose your Firebase project
   - Accept the default file names for rules and indexes

4. Deploy your Firestore rules:
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

5. Deploy your Firestore indexes:
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

=====================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
=====================================================

- The firestore.rules file contains security rules that allow read access
  to parties without authentication, but require authentication for writes.

- The firestore.indexes.json file contains all the necessary indexes for
  your queries to work properly.

- If you're still seeing index errors, you may need to manually create
  the indexes by clicking on the links in the error messages.

- Make sure you're logged in to the correct Firebase project.
